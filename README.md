Image Encryption Tool
Description
This project is a simple image encryption tool developed as part of Task-02 at Prodigy InfoTech. The tool uses pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. This basic form of encryption swaps pixel values and applies mathematical operations to protect the image data.

Features
Image Encryption: Encrypts an input image by modifying pixel values using a specified key.
Image Decryption: Decrypts the encrypted image using the same key to restore the original image.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for the program.
PIL (Pillow): Python Imaging Library used for handling image operations.
NumPy: Library used for array manipulations and mathematical operations.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed.
Pillow and NumPy libraries installed.
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install Pillow numpy
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the image_encryption.py file to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Angryskull451/Image_Encryption_Tool.git
cd Image_Encryption_Tool
Prepare an input image:

Ensure the input image file is in the same directory as the script.
You can replace input_image.png with the name of your input image.
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python image_encryption.py
Encryption and Decryption:

The script will save two new images: encrypted_image.png and decrypted_image.png.
Open these images to see the results of encryption and decryption.
Example
Here's how you can run the script:

python
Copy code
# Example usage within the script
encrypt_image('input_image.png', 'encrypted_image.png', 50)
decrypt_image('encrypted_image.png', 'decrypted_image.png', 50)
Project Structure
bash

Important Notes
Make sure that the image files you want to encrypt and decrypt are present in the same directory as image_encryption.py.
The script uses a basic mathematical operation for encryption. This is not suitable for high-security applications but serves as a foundational example of image encryption.
